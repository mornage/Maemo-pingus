      This is a good introduction level. The good thing about it is
      that you can finish it even if the single basher doesn't manage
      to get through the pillar in the middle (which occurs more often
      than not since the basher seems to stop too early almost all the
      time) by placing a stopper there and letting it explode. You
      only have to take care not to waste stairs :-)
